# SpaceCheatMode
An old cheat for Among Us I made years ago


##WARNINGS:
- The pointers are outdated and need to be updated to the latest among us version in order for the cheat to work.
- As you can see in the code, this only works along with MagicMushroom.dll which you can find on this repository: 
- The packages included in the solution are most likely outdated as well
- The exe that you build has to be in the same directory as MagicMushroom.dll

The code is pretty bad since this is basically the first project I have ever made (apart from ppcheatmode which had an awful UI lol)
